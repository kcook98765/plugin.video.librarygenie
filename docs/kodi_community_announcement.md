# LibraryGenie ‚Äî Smart Lists & Folders for Kodi (Public Release + Invite-Only AI Alpha)

Hi everyone! üëã

I'm excited to share **LibraryGenie**, a brand new Kodi addon focused on intelligent list management and clean navigation. Build hierarchical folders, curate lists from anywhere in Kodi via context menus, and manage collections without fighting the UI.

**Important:** LibraryGenie ships with a full set of list/folder features for **all users**. There's also an **invite-only Alpha** of AI-powered search. The Alpha requires access to a private server and is **not** enabled by default. Details below.

## What you can do today (Available to everyone)

‚Ä¢ **Hierarchical Organization**: Create nested folders and lists with unlimited depth
‚Ä¢ **Manual Curation**: Add items from any addon/source via context menus with proper playback support
‚Ä¢ **Batch Operations**: Work efficiently with large collections
‚Ä¢ **Smart Navigation**: Modal/clean interfaces with built-in UI conflict protection
‚Ä¢ **Sorting & Viewing**: Proper ListItem construction and sort methods
‚Ä¢ **Reliable Playback**: Fixed URL generation ensures all manually added items play correctly
‚Ä¢ **Robust Internals**: SQLite storage, JSON-RPC integration, detailed logging, settings

No remote services required. Install and start organizing immediately.

## Invite-Only Alpha: AI-Powered Search (Not in general release)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Status Notice**: These features require special server access and are only available to invited testers.

‚Ä¢ **Natural-Language Search**: "psychological thrillers with plot twists," "80s/90s comedies," etc.
‚Ä¢ **Semantic Matching**: Embedding-based results ranked by relevance
‚Ä¢ **Automatic Library Matching**: Connects results to your local Kodi library based on previously uploaded list of imdb numbers in your library
‚Ä¢ **Dynamic Lists & History**: Saved searches which can be moved to standard list location.
‚Ä¢ **Remote API Pairing**: 8-digit code or API key; chunked/delta sync of identifiers

### Alpha Privacy & Data (Read first)

‚Ä¢ **Only data sent from Kodi to the server:** your library's **IMDb IDs** (you must have IMDb IDs to use the Alpha) and the **text you type into the search box**.
‚Ä¢ **No tracking of playback or usage**: No watched history, no play events, no file paths, no extra telemetry.
‚Ä¢ **Lists are local**: All lists generated by searches are stored in Kodi only. If your Alpha access ends, your lists **remain in Kodi** (they are not saved on the server).
‚Ä¢ **Eligibility during Alpha**: Currently accepting libraries sized **2,000‚Äì10,000** items. The system has been **tested on a library of ~8,500**.

## Installation

### From ZIP

1. Download the latest LibraryGenie ZIP from the releases page
2. Kodi ‚Üí **Add-ons** ‚Üí **Install from ZIP file**
3. Select the downloaded ZIP
4. Wait for installation confirmation

### From Repository

1. Add the LibraryGenie repository
2. Kodi ‚Üí **Add-ons** ‚Üí **Install from repository**
3. Choose LibraryGenie ‚Üí **Install**

## Getting Started (Everyone)

‚Ä¢ Open **Add-ons ‚Üí Video add-ons ‚Üí LibraryGenie**
‚Ä¢ Use the **Options & Tools** menu to:
  ‚Äì Create folders/lists
  ‚Äì Manage and move lists
  ‚Äì Configure settings
‚Ä¢ From any media item's **context menu**, choose **LibraryGenie** to add to a list

## Using the Options & Tools Menu

### Always available
‚Ä¢ Create New List / Create New Folder
‚Ä¢ Settings (debug logging, performance, navigation protection)

### Visible only when applicable
‚Ä¢ (Alpha) Search Movies ‚Äî appears only if you're authenticated to the remote API
‚Ä¢ (Alpha) Search History ‚Äî appears after you've run at least one search

## Alpha Setup (Invite-Only)

### Easy Pairing

1. I will supply a one time code when I invite you
2. Addon Settings ‚Üí **Remote API** ‚Üí **Setup Remote API (Easy)**
3. Enter the 8-digit code when prompted

### Library Sync (Identifiers only)
‚Ä¢ After setup, choose **Upload IMDB List to Server** ‚Äî this sends **IMDb IDs** in chunks (no titles, paths, or playback info).
‚Ä¢ After sync (and some backend processing of movies not yet collected and preprocessed), searches will be able to limit to your library contents. So you do not wnt to share access with others, as any upload of imdb numbers would overwrite and cause un-synched results.


## Troubleshooting

‚Ä¢ **Lists not displaying**: Enable debug logging and check for database messages
‚Ä¢ **Navigation conflicts**: Built-in protection minimizes duplicate/stacked UIs
‚Ä¢ **Context menu missing**: Verify the addon is installed and enabled
‚Ä¢ **Manual items not playing**: Recent fix ensures proper file path URLs instead of invalid movieid:// protocols
‚Ä¢ **Debug mode**: Turn on debug logging, reproduce the issue, and check Kodi logs for lines prefixed with [LibraryGenie]

### Alpha-only notes
‚Ä¢ "Search Movies" button missing ‚Üí confirm remote API is configured and your Alpha access is active
‚Ä¢ Local match issues ‚Üí ensure IMDb ID upload completed successfully
